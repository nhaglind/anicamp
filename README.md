# Anicamp

Currently developing an application that would work with multiple domains using database multi-tenancy for Rack (and Rails) by using the <a href="https://github.com/influitive/apartment">apartment</a> gem.

In flux is choosing a proper video hosting provider that would allow private user upload that can be viewed only within the application.
